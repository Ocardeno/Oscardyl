                Social reintegration is often understood as the support given to
                offenders during their reentry into society following
                imprisonment. A broader definition, however, encompasses a
                number of interventions undertaken following an arrest to divert
                offenders away from the criminal justice system to an
                alternative measure, including a restorative justice process or
                suitable treatment.
              </p>
              <p>
                In recent years, more emphasis has been placed on designing
                comprehensive interventions, based on a continuity of care, to
                provide consistent assistance to offenders within and beyond
                prison. There is a recognition that preparation for
                reintegration should commence before the offenders' release.
                After their release, interventions should support their
                immediate transition from the prison to the community and
                reinforce the gains achieved through in prison treatment and
                continue until a successful reintegration is completed (Fox,
                2002).
